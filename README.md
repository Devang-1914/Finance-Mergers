# Finance-Mergers
—This project explores the intricacies of Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) through the development of a Python and Streamlit-based tool, aiming to automate and simplify the calculation of critical financial metrics such as Earnings Per Share (EPS), Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio, Debt-to-Equity (D/E) ratio, and Return on Equity (ROE). By providing a detailed analysis of these metrics before and after M&A transactions, the tool facilitates a comprehensive evaluation of the financial health and strategic positioning of entities involved in M&A. It
classifies mergers based on stake percentages post-transaction into Acquisition, Majority Acquisition, and Merger of Equals, offering insights into the strategic dynamics of each type. The
methodology incorporates an analysis of financial performance and merger classification, enhancing stakeholders’ understanding of M&A implications. This study not only highlights the importance of financial metrics in evaluating M&A activities but also demonstrates how technological innovation can streamline complex financial analyses. The findings point to the potential for improved decision-making processes, suggesting avenues for future research in sector-specific analyses and the development of predictive models for M&A success. This approach underscores the significance of blending financial evaluation with strategic considerations in corporate restructuring.
